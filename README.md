## The project is a Java application that demonstrates the implementation of the Observer and Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) design patterns. Below is a description of the key components and their roles :

### Observer Pattern

#### `observer.architecture` Package
- **`Observer` Interface**: Defines the `update` method that observers must implement.
- **`ConcreteObserver` Class**: Implements the `Observer` interface and provides a concrete implementation of the `update` method.
- **`Subject` Abstract Class**: Manages a list of observers using weak references to avoid memory leaks. It provides methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
- **`ConcreteSubject` Class**: Extends the `Subject` class and includes state management. When the state changes, it notifies all attached observers.

#### `observer.example` Package
- **`Stocks` Class**: Represents a stock data source that observers can attach to. It extends the `Subject` class.
- **`StatuBar` Class**: An observer that updates a status bar based on stock data.
- **`StatusListView` Class**: An observer that updates a list view based on stock data.

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

#### `pub_sub.architecture` Package
- **`MessageBroker` Class**: Manages subscriptions and publishes messages to subscribers based on topics.
- **`Message` Class**: Represents a message that can be published to subscribers.
- **`Publisher` Class**: Represents a publisher that sends messages to the message broker.
- **`Subscriber` Class**: Represents a subscriber that listens for messages on a specific topic.


#### `pub_sub.example` Package
- **`UserService` Class**: Publishes user registration events to the message broker.
- **`AnalyticsService` Class**: Subscribes to user registration events and processes them.
- **`EmailService` Class**: Subscribes to user registration events and sends emails.
- **`UserRegistrationMessage` Class**: Represents a message containing user registration details.

### Main Class
- **`Main` Class**: Demonstrates the usage of both the Observer and Pub/Sub patterns. It creates instances of subjects and observers, attaches observers to subjects, and triggers state changes to show how observers are notified. It also sets up the message broker, subscribes services to a topic, and publishes events.


This project provides a clear example of how to implement and use the Observer and Pub/Sub design patterns in Java.
